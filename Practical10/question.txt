Q1: What country or countries have recorded a DALYs greater than 650,000 in a single year?
Q2: Draw boxplots of DALYs across countries from 1990 to 2019.

Discuss (line 42-65): 
Answer1 (line 53): DALYs are 693367.49 in 1994 in Rwanda. However, before or after 1994, 
the DALYs in Rwanda are extremely lower than 1994. This may contribute to the
outbreaks or the statistical errors in the data.

Answer2(line 57-65): Boxplots demonstate that DALYs among all countries were decreasing from
1990 to 2019. This probably indicated a better healthcare system and  a improved
treatment of the diseases.
